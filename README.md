# CATS
CATS stands for __Cards And Ticket Storage__. It is an app that allows the storage and display of barcodes on a pebble watch.

Checkout this [video](https://youtu.be/KuDBV92Z0rw) for a demostration of functionalities.

Tested with a tesco clubcard on a original pebble on a self-checkout counter. This app can in theory work with any loyalty cards that uses a barcode.
